Odin Recipes Project
Hi, my name is Ananta and I started the Odin Project about two weeks ago.
I am at the point in the course where TOP has asked me to create a website with a main index page with a link to a few recipes. 
It's not gonna look pretty at first but I hope that you can join me on this journey to make it worthy of publishing one day.
