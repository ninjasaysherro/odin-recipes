    </p>
    <p>This is more of a guideline than it is a recipe, please feel free to adjust based on your preferences and tastes.
        Season and flavor to your liking. In this recipe, I will also give reasonings for adjustments in the recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 lbs</strong> russet or yellow potatoes</li>
            <p>The standard for preparing mashed potatoes, these are the best for mashing. But don't mash too much or you'll end up with glue!</p>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> unsalted butter </li>
            <p>Depending on how <em>buttery</em> you want your potatoes, this can be adjusted to your liking.</p>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> Heavy cream, light cream, or whole milk</li>
            <p>Whichever dairy product you use, adjust the recipe to the desired consistency. You may wish to use more if you feel like the recipe doesn't include enough.</p>
            <li><strong>About 1/2 to 1/3 cup</strong> grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <p>This will increase the saltiness of the mashed potatoes so taste the mashed potatoes at this point and season accordingly.</p>
            <li><strong>1-2 tbsp</strong> of garlic powder</li>
            <p>Adds a bit of depth to the mashed potatoes, you don't have to use it but I like it. Adjust to taste if used.</p>
            <li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong>, to taste</li>
            <p>Self-explanatory. Always season your food!</p>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to boil. Add potatoes until tender but firm. This will take about 15 minutes. Drain the water.</li>
            <li>While the potatoes are cooking, in a small saucepan and heat the butter and milk until the butter is fully melted.</li>
            <li>In a seperate bowl, mash potatoes until there are no more large chunks of potato left. Do not over-mash the potatoes or the potatoes will become gluey.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the milk and butter mixture into potatoes and fold to desired fluffiness.</li>
            <li>Add the parmesan cheese and garlic powder(optional) to the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
