    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to boil. Add potatoes until tender but firm. This will take about 15 minutes. Drain the water.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>While the potatoes are cooking, in a small saucepan and heat the butter and milk until milk has taken on a pale yellow color.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>In a seperate bowl, mash potatoes until there are no more large chunks of potato left. Do not over-mash the potatoes or the potatoes will become gluey.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Slowly add the milk and butter mixture into potatoes and fold to desired fluffiness.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Add the parmesan cheese and garlic powder(optional) to the potatoes.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Sprinkle some chopped chives on top to add some color contrast, if you'd like!</li>
