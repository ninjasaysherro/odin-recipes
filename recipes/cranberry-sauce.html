            <li>Boil water and sugar in a medium-sized saucepan on high and bring to a boil. Stir to dissolve the sugar.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Add the cranberries and return to a boil. Cook the cranberries until they burst. Afterwards, lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes or until most of the cranberries have burst.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Stir in mix-ins, if any. Once the cranberries have burst, you can leave it as is, or add other optional ingredients.</li>

            <li>Remove the pot from heat and let it cool. It should be cooled completely at room temperature. Transfer to a bowl and let chill in the fridge. The sauce will continue to thicken as it cools down. </li>
