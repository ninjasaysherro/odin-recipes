    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 1/2 loaves</strong> bread, cubed, preferably toasted or stale</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>3 cups</strong> sweet or yellow onion, diced. <em>about 2 large onions</em></li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>2 cups</strong> celery, diced</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>6 cloves</strong> garlic, minced</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>3 tbsp</strong> fresh sage, chopped</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>3 tbsp</strong> fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>3 tbsp</strong> fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>2 1/2 cups</strong> chicken or veggie stock</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>2</strong> eggs, large</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <p></p>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F. Brush a 9x13 baking dish with melted butter, olive oil, or spray with non-stick spray.
                Place the bread in a large mixing bowl and set aside.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Heat some butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Once melted, stir in onion, celery, and garlic with a big pinch of salt and peper - at least 3/4 teaspoons of each. Cook until onions and celery have become soft and translucent.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Then, stir in the chopped sage, parsley, and rosemary. Set some aside for later to sprinkle. Cook this until you can really smell the herbs. Next, stir in a cup of stock.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Pour the onion and celery mix into the bowl of bread cubes and toss to coat the bread crumbs.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk the remaining 1 1/2 cups of stock and the 2 eggs.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Pour that mixture into the bread cubes and stir and fold until thoroughly combined. </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bake the stuffing for about 45-50 minutes, until the internal temperature reads 160F. If it starts getting too brown, you can lay some foil over it.</li>
        </ol>
